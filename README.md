## Hi there ðŸ‘‹I am Nandisa Dlamini

ðŸ§ ðŸ’» Hey! I'm currently leveling up from "Googles everything" to "Writes code that sometimes works on the first try." I'm a software development learner who's bravely navigating the wild jungle of bugs, semicolons, and Stack Overflow tabs.

Currently poking at JavaScript ðŸ”®, and making pixels behave with HTML & CSS ðŸŽ¨. I'm all about learning by doing (and occasionally breaking things in spectacular fashion).

If you're into coding, memes, or watching someone slowly become fluent in developer-speak, stick around. Letâ€™s debug life togetherâ€”one curly brace at a time.




Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
